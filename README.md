# Little docker test
Simple playground to illustrate possible docker setups that:

- Features static frontend sites(HTMX ðŸ™‚)
- Features a minimal PHP container which responds with "Hello, World!" and an incrementing counter(Swoole)
- Features a 3rd party service (Mailhog)
- Exposes a load balancer/reverse proxy(Caddy)
- Separates the 3rd party services into their own network that cannot directly talk to our 1st party applications through

# Usage

Simply update your hosts or DNS to forward all requests to main.test, docs.test, and prototype.test to 127.0.0.1, and run `make optionX` replacing `X` with the [option](##Differences-between-the-docker-compose-files) that you would like to explore.

Then you can visit `http://main.test:8080`, `http://docs.test:8080`, and `http://prototype.test:8080`.

## Hosts
```bash
echo '127.0.0.1 main.test'      | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo '127.0.0.1 docs.test'      | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
echo '127.0.0.1 prototype.test' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

## Differences between the docker compose files
The differences are listed at the top of each docker compose file, so check there for the most up-to-date information, yet as of the time of writing, the differences are as follows:

### Option 1
This docker compose gives a less explicit view into which static assets are being served by having all sites served through the /sites folder.
This can be a little confusing at first glance yet allows us to deploy new sites by just changing the caddy file and reloading caddy.

### Option 2
This docker compose gives a more explicit view into which static assets are being served by having each one be in its own volume.
The downside being needing to redeploy the stack whenever we want to add any new sites

### Option 3
This docker compose gives an even more explicit view into which static assets are being served by having each one be in its container.
The downside being needing to redeploy the stack whenever we want to add any new sites
However, an additional upside is slightly more granular control over the environment that each static site is in.
This does come with its own downside though, being additional overhead and resources.
