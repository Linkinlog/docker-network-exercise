# This docker compose gives an even more explicit view into which static assets are being served by having each one be in its container.
# The downside being needing to redeploy the stack whenever we want to add any new sites
# However, an additional upside is slightly more granular control over the environment that each static site is in.
# This does come with its own downside though, being additional overhead and resources.
